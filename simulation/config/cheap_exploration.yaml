# ============================================================================
# CHEAP MODELS - Use these for initial exploration
# ============================================================================
# Cost comparison (approximate per 1M tokens):
#   claude-opus-4-5-20251101: $15/$75 (input/output) - EXPENSIVE
#   gpt-5.2: ~$10/$30 - EXPENSIVE
#   claude-sonnet-4-20250514: $3/$15 - MODERATE
#   claude-haiku-3-5-20241022: $0.80/$4 - CHEAP
#   gpt-4o-mini: $0.15/$0.60 - VERY CHEAP
#   meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct: $0.40/$0.40 (OpenRouter) - CHEAP
#   deepseek/deepseek-chat: $0.14/$0.28 (OpenRouter) - VERY CHEAP

models:
  # Tier 1: Very cheap screening models
  - "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"        # Fast, cheap, good instruction following
  # - "gpt-4o-mini"                    # Uncomment if you have OpenAI key

  # Tier 2: Cheap but more capable (via OpenRouter)
  # - "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"
  # - "deepseek/deepseek-chat"

  # Tier 3: Known high-misalignment models (from previous research)
  # - "meta-llama/llama-4-maverick"    # 66.7% harmful in murder scenario
