## Issues Fixed

### Critical Issues (3)

1. **Missing Interface Stubs** - Added ILocomotion.h and ISensorSource.h interface definitions and tasks
2. **CycloneDDS Configuration Missing** - Added configuration section with cyclonedds.xml example
3. **Dockerfile Location Ambiguity** - Updated all task references to use `docker/Dockerfile` and `docker/docker-compose.yml`

### Enhancements Applied (4)

1. Added explicit CMake 3.16+ minimum version requirement
2. Added .dockerignore to task list and file list
3. Added complete CMakeLists.txt skeleton with all dependencies
4. Updated File List with all new files (config/cyclonedds.xml, interfaces, .dockerignore)

## Recommendations

### Completed

All critical issues and enhancements have been applied to the story file.

### For Implementation

The story is now ready for development with:
- Clear file paths for all Docker files
- Complete CMakeLists.txt reference
- Interface stubs for sim/real abstraction
- CycloneDDS configuration for hardware connectivity
