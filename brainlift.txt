Brainlift: Unitree G1 Construction Inspector Robot
Purpose

Use the Unitree G1 as a mobile, embodied agent capable of:

Walking a construction site (interior framing, MEP rough-in, open slab, exterior shell).

Capturing structured inspection data: photos, LiDAR-like depth, thermal (optional), audio, annotations.

Detecting code compliance issues (clearances, fire blocking, nail patterns, plumbing vents, grease duct slope, etc.).

Performing routine QA/QC: comparing as-built vs BIM model.

Enforcing safety (missing guard rails, tripping hazards, OSHA issues).

Acting as a digital inspector assistant: querying site conditions, generating reports, flagging issues, and syncing to Procore.

This becomes a deep agent that continuously:

Perceives → 2. Thinks → 3. Plans → 4. Acts → 5. Reflects → 6. Improves

Spiky POVs
Truths
1. Construction inspection is 80% “seeing” and 20% “touching.”

A humanoid with locomotion + cameras is already 80% of what you need.
Arms become useful for pushing drywall, opening doors, or pointing sensors.

2. The value is not the robot—it’s the consistent, structured data it collects.

Contractors struggle because humans collect inconsistent photos.
Robots can do the same walk every day, aligned with BIM coordinates.

3. Safety compliance is the killer app.

Missing railings, trench protection, ladder safety, PPE compliance → robots do this better than tired humans.

Myths
1. “Humanoids can’t operate on messy construction sites.”

False — with proper “terrain moding” (rubber mats, dirt, debris recognition), the G1 can safely travel most indoor sites.

2. “You need a super dexterous robot hand for inspection.”

Wrong — almost every inspection task is vision + measurement, not manipulation.

3. “Robots will replace human inspectors.”

No — robots generate structured evidence; humans still interpret final compliance and sign off.

Category 1: Locomotion on Construction Terrain

Summary:
Construction sites introduce:

uneven surfaces

loose cables

debris

ladders, stairs

narrow hallways

incomplete floors

The G1 must use:

depth + stereo mapping

terrain classification

safe path planning

“stop if uncertain” heuristics

Insights:

G1 can be trained via sim → real to walk through framed rooms

Key is cautious control + lidar-like stereo depth

Category 2: Vision + LLM Inspection Intelligence

Summary:
The G1 becomes an inspector by pairing its camera suite with LLM vision models:

Capabilities:

Check stud spacing

Identify missing fire blocking

Check GFCI placement

Detect unprotected edges

Identify incorrect vent piping

Compare rough-in locations to BIM/plan

LLM + vision models (GPT-V, VLA) can do:

“Show me all code violations in this room”

“Is this 6” exhaust duct sloped correctly?”

“Are the anchor bolts at correct spacing?”

Category 3: Data Capture & Digital Twin Integration

Summary:
The G1 walks the same route daily → captures data → syncs to:

Procore

Autodesk Construction Cloud

BIM 360

Your custom GC platform

It builds a temporal digital twin:

Today’s as-built vs yesterday vs last week
→ change detection
→ progress tracking
→ risk scoring

Category 4: Deep Agent Architecture for Inspection

Summary:
The G1 construction inspector agent loop:

Perceive: RGB + IR + IMU + depth mapping

Localize: SLAM / BIM coordinates

Plan: LLM generates inspection checklist

Navigate: walk route → avoid hazards

Inspect: vision-based recognition

Log: create issues + photos + measurements
